The numb, paralyzing sensation,
I feel when I look into your clear,
Blue eyes
Your quirky persona,
Loving gestures of friendship maybe more?
I love your purple shirt.
The thoughts of your chiseled body,
the feel of your skin
I feel like I can tell you anything,
everything,
You don't judge me.
The connection,
your commitment,
my desire.

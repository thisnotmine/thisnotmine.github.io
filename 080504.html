<pre>
Stop and take a breather, step away from your life for a while.
Just take a look at how far you've come, is this where you thought you'd be?
We only have a short time & there's so much to see.
But you ain't fonnna make a difference sitting here and watching it pass you by.

Just take a moment and let your thought wander high & low.
Go a little slower, one step at a time.
Stop for a second & take some time to cry even if you don't know why.

You can take a day off just be lazy & hang out for a while, catch yourself wearing a smile.
Take a seat at the crossroads in life, decide which way you're going to  go.
You can give yourself a minute of meditation, before you go full speed.

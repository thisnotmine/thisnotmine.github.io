I really never meant to break your heart
buts it's not my fault that I've felt like
this from the start
Just tell me what you wanted me to say
This is the only way

When I start to think about the way our
lives used to be,
When I see all those pictures of you & me
I can't help but feel like I've done something wrong,
Like maybe I'de been giving up on us
all along

Because I've been so busy,
I've been so preoccupied,
making so many excuses, & though
they're valid,
Am I the one who's breaking us apart?

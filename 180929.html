<pre>
He's just boppin' around,
Going his own way,
Just trying to make it through,
day by day.

He's biking downtown,
looking around, with a red duffel bag
strapped over his back.

Who knows? He might have
kids at home

Who knows? He might not have a home
Who knows? He might be
fearing for his life.

Cuz in this society, robotic
community, that we have created
there's only artificial reality.

Oh, I was so terribly afraid that this might
be the end..
that I might never get to call you even my
friend
I was so scared that I might never be able to
see your face again.
Oh, that would be worse than losing my life

I don't know exactly what it is that struck
me to begin with
I just feel like I'm not living unless I'm
with you
And I get so disoriented & distracted when I 
don't see you
But I'm still kind like that, in a different
way when I do.

Tell me that there will never be a last
time
Tell me you feel the same way too
Tell me that you will never forget me
Tell me that we'll always be together

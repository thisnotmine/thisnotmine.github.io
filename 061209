All I want to do is listen to blasting,
fucking senseless noise,
to cry out at the top of my lungs,
scream,
let tears fall for eternity;
because I can't find the answers,
because I'm so lost & confused,
because evil is inevitable,
and we suffer withou reason.

I was going through the motions
and saw him walking in,
for a split second I was blissfully happy
and was thankful for the real mirage...

Next think I know he walks right to ...her.
There goes my crush, my man,
staight towards a girl whom I wish didn't exist.
The worst part is that it was when I was working and sh works there too.

It just hurts, it's ripping open my heart.

Fuck.

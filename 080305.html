I don't want you to think I'm choosing her over you.
Even though at this stage, that's what I'm supposed to be doing.
I'm sorry if you think I'd rather be with her because
right now what't going on between us, you wouldn't understand.

Don't just  assume that it has to be one or the other
If you don't want to go a certain way, you can always
make your own path.
Walking on your own is hard but it's not always lonely
If you've made the right choice people will eventually join you

Sometimes I honestly don't want to make up my mind
I'd be quite content living in a moment, just being
undecisive, but that't not really living.
And I dont want to have to listen to reality
I don't want to hear anout what really happening.

Now I'm coming to terms with the way things are
No one knows everything, we make mistakes & have to face our fears.
And our thoughts & decisions help us find our way.

<pre>Yeah, he's gorgeous but could I really  take him from you.
No matter how  sad I seem, no matter how mean I'm willing to be;
you're more important; you're worth more;
he's yours.</pre>

It's time to settle the score, I don't want him no more.
I refuse to be desperate, if he wants me,
he can come & ge me, I'm done fighting,
if he doesn't want me, guess what he can't have me.

For now, it hirts, but the pain will go away & I know
that if I list you, things would never be okay,
He's not my soulmate, just a crush & I know that
you love him so much.

I know there's someone better for me, I know this is the way
it's meant to be, he's meant for you,

not 
  for 
     me.

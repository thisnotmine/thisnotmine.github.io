All of a sudden, it seems like I have to decide my life right now,
Everything is becoming a life's decision,
it's time to be serious, no time for enjoyment, no time for fun; school comes first.

I like to strive for greatness,
I wan't to be successful but I know that I can only do so much,
something has to eventually be sacrified.

In this completely crazy world of competition, you ain't going nowhere
if you're second best. Glimpses of fun are all you get to see,

For God's sake, you better not be getting lower than 90%!

I'm not perfect, I'm not invincible but I don't want to give anything up.
But there's so many things that I want to change.
I'mnot superhuman and I'm not sure of my destiny,
the options are overwhelming, the world is so intimidating!

I'll try to make the right choices when it really matters, 
it's up to me to do the best with what happens, 
to be the best I can be with what I've been given.

Everything it changes, but in so many ways it don't, no it don't.
I know what I can always start over, but some things are with you forever.
There's certain things I would never leave behind. 
Experiences that make me who I am, people who've helped me to see the truth in life,
I would  never leave them behind.

And then there's also those painful memoeries that will always be in the back of my mind.
What kind of world wouild we be in if everything stayed the same forever?
How could anyone grow if nothig ever changed.
If time seemed to never change, my life felt like it stopped,
I would be the onle one to glame if I forced my life to stay the same.

Truth however forces me to see reason, it's impossible, not worth it at all.
It's a part of life, don't try to fight, you've got to keep living your life.

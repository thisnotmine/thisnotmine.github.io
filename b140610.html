Secret, my dear friend
Please tell me we'll be friends until
the end.
My darling, Secret
your honesty has always made me free,
Secret, Secret,
you're changing,
I can feel our friendship rearranging.
At least you & I are able to talk about it,
but can we reach a compromise.
I'm sorry, but I just can't drink like you.
I'm sorry, but I'm wired a different way.
I don't know what to say.
Secrete, don't let our friendship float away.

I want you to love me for who I am
I want to <del>love you</del>, be able to love you,
trust you, live with you forever.
But I want to be strong enough to not surrender all of my feelings to you,
just in case you hurt me.

I long to be honest with you, and I desire for you to
be the one who'll be honest & true to me too.

I'm petrified of the thought alone of experiencing a love-
filled, heart wrenching, loveless, lost relationship.

I don't want to cringe at your touch,
I don't want us to be based on lust.
I don't want to look into your eyes & feel embarrassed.

I want you to love me for me and I want to
trust myself to love you and know you'll be true.
